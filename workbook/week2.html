                <p class="body-text"> In my first attempt I focused mainly on creative ways to combine text and image, including utilising image carousels as well as overlapping text and image. </p>
                <p class="body-text"> I also explored creative ways to implement a navigation bar, whether it be semi-hidden, part of a drop down hamburger menu, scrollable carousel, or overlapped with text. I aimed to implement a navigation bar for ease of use and accessibility.</p>

                <p class="body-text">My second round of crazy 8s included using more visual imagery, including a Y2k aesthetic phone, a television with remote, a scrollable mindmap, bubbles and hidden images that pop out when hovered over.</p>
                <p class="body-text"> I also explored making the page continually scrollable from all directions. Whilst not the most accessible on mobile, it inspires endless creativity and exploration on desktop. </p>

                <p class="body-text">For assignment 2, I'd specifically like to learn how to code a carousel for better image layout such as those below. I'd also like to experiment with animation and hiding items on pages so the user can only see one section at a time. For the time being I have aimed to do this through the use of padding.</p>
